# Kaggle-Competition
In this project i set out to give my initial submission to a kaggle competition project.<br>
The goal is to form a multi-class machine learning algorithm that can be used to predict a compound MOA given its cellular signature.<br>
MoA stands for Mechanism Of Action-a short hand used by medical scientists to refer to the biological activity of a given molecule.<br>
The data sets used in this project can be found on kaggle with this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/data
